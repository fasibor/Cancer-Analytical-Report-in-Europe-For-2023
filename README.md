![Task 34A - Cancer Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/334fa835-f5de-4553-8211-bdb213fa37b0)



## Overview  
This analysis explores clinical outcomes and patient characteristics among individuals diagnosed with various stages of cancer and receiving different types of treatment. It investigates survival trends and health indicatorsâ€”such as **BMI**, **cholesterol**, **comorbidities**, **smoking status**, and **family history**â€”to uncover actionable insights that can improve patient outcomes and inform data-driven cancer care strategies.


## Objectives
- Analyze cancer survival outcomes across treatment types  
- Identify health and lifestyle factors influencing survival  
- Assess hereditary, behavioral, and comorbid risks  
- Uncover seasonal or regional diagnosis patterns  
- Support clinical decisions with real-world patient data  



## Why This Project is Useful  
With rising cancer prevalence and complex treatment dynamics, understanding patient data is critical for effective care. This project offers insights that:

- Clarify patterns tied to survival outcomes  
- Inform public health strategies and policy design  
- Guide preventive care for high-risk populations  
- Optimize resource allocation in healthcare systems  
- Strengthen personalized and region-specific interventions  



## Key Findings

- **High and Even Cancer Incidence in Select Countries**  
Malta, Ireland, Portugal, and France show consistently high case counts, suggesting regional or lifestyle-related contributors.

- **Family History Plays a Major Role**  
~50% of patients report a family history of cancer, pointing to strong hereditary influence.

- **January Sees a Diagnosis Surge**  
A notable spike in diagnoses occurs in January, possibly due to renewed healthcare engagement post-holiday season.

- **BMI Uniformly High Across Demographics**  
Average BMI ranges from 30â€“31 across patients, reflecting widespread obesity as a common risk factor.

- **Unexpected Smokingâ€“Survival Correlation**  
Never smokers had slightly lower survival rates than passive/former smokers; patients with a family history showed slightly better survival.

- **Elevated Cholesterol Across All Groups**  
Even children in early-stage cancer had high cholesterol, with consistently elevated levels across ages and stages.


## Actionable Recommendations

- **Regional Risk Factor Collaboration**  
  Initiate joint studies to uncover shared environmental or lifestyle-related cancer risks.

- **Prioritize Genetic Screening**  
  Launch nationwide programs for genetic testing and education, especially for high-risk families.

- **Leverage Seasonal Diagnosis Trends**  
  Align cancer awareness campaigns and screening initiatives with January surges.

- **Combat Obesity Proactively**  
  Implement national strategies around nutrition education, school reforms, and public fitness programs.

- **Rethink Smoking-Centric Screening**  
  Continue tobacco control while expanding early detection efforts for genetically predisposed individuals.

- **Include Cholesterol Management in Cancer Care**  
  Monitor diet and cholesterol throughout treatment and encourage inter-sector health collaborations.



## Final Thoughts  
This project highlights how patient-level analytics can shape smarter clinical and public health strategies. Data-informed action is crucial to improving cancer outcomes, reducing risk exposure, and delivering equitable healthcare.
